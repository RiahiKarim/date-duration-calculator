## Build & Development
### Setup

Fork and clone the repo. 
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/RiahiKarim/ng4.git
```

`cd` into it and install npm dependencies:

```shell
$ cd ng4
$ npm install
```

Install angular-cli:

```shell
$ npm install @angular/cli -g
```

This next step will be the only one you will use from now-on:

```shell
$ ng serve
```

This will rebuild the site in dev mode and start the application. You can access the application on `localhost:4200`.
